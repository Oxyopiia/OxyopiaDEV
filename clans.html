      You can access your clan by clicking on the Golden Helmet icon in /clans.

    <h3>Clan Rating</h3>
    <p>
      Clan Rating is a <b>general</b> basis on how good your Clan is, and allows you to compare your Clan against others. Rating is a combination of:
        • Clan Tokens
        • Average Clan Member KD (this is scaled up a bit, and does show your actual avg KD)
        • Reputation
        • Clan Level
