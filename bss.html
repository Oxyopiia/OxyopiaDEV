        <p>Hello! You are probably accessing this page after trying to reach out to me about my Bee Swarm Simulator guides.<br />
            I would like to make it apparent that the guides are now <b>out-of-date</b>, as the guides were made in January 2022, over a year ago now!<br /><br />
        
            You can find more up-to-date guides in numerous places, mainly:
        <li>
            <ul>- <a href="https://discord.gg/bee">Bee Swarm Discord</a></ul>
            <ul>- <a href="https://discord.gg/beeswarmers">Bee Swarmers Discord</a></ul>
            <ul>and probably more that I do not know of!</ul>
        </li><br /><br />
    
        In addition, I am no longer playing Bee Swarm, so please do not ask me for advice, purely as I will probably give a wrong answer.</p>
