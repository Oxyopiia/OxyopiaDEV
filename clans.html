    <h3>Creating/Managing a Clan</h3>
    <p>
      You can create a Clan in the /clans menu for $25,000 by clicking the emerald icon.<br />
      You can access your clan by clicking on the Golden Helmet icon in /clans.<br />
      You can manage members in your Clan menu by clicking on the player heads in the third row of the chest. In there you can invite members, unlock new slots, or manage existing members.
    </p>
    <h3>Clan Tokens and Other Stats</h3>
    <p>
      Clan Tokens are the main currency used in Clans. Each kill a Clan member gets gives 1 Clan Token towards the Clan. These can be spent in many shops, including the Upgrade Shop, Boosters, Clan Icons and more!<br />
      
      Reputation is a measure of kills-to-deaths in your Clan, and is a good way of gauging the skill level of your clan. This is not the same as a kill-to-death-<b>ratio</b>, and is instead the total number of \(kills - deaths\)
    <h3>Clan Rating</h3>
    <p>
      Clan Rating is a <b>general</b> basis on how good your Clan is, and allows you to compare your Clan against others. Rating is a combination of:<br />
        • Clan Tokens<br />
        • Average Clan Member KD (this is scaled up a bit, and does show your actual avg KD)<br />
        • Reputation<br />
        • Clan Level
